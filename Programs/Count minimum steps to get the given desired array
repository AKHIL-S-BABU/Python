Consider an array with n elements and value of all the elements is zero.
We can perform following operations on the array. 
      1)Incremental operations:Choose 1 element from the array and increment its value by 1.
      2)Doubling operation: Double the values of all the elements of array.
      
sample Input: "16 16 16"
      Output: [8, 8, 8]     # i've added print statement on each dividing statement to better understand the code
              1
              [4, 4, 4]     #only the final print statement to print the count is needed
              2
              [2, 2, 2]
              3
              [0, 0, 0]
              7
              final count 7


arr=list(map(int, input().split(" ")))    #instead of using " map " you could ask for the array inputs in an for loop
c=0
count=0
def double(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        arr[i]=int(arr[i]/2)
    return arr
z=0
while(z!=len(arr)):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if(arr[i]%2==1):
            arr[i]-=1
            count+=1
        
    double(arr)
    count+=1
    z=0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if(arr[i]%2==1):
            arr[i]-=1
            count+=1
        if(arr[i]==0):
            z=z+1
    print(arr)
    print(count)
print("final count",count)
